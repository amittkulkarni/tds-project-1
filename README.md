- Data was scraped from the GitHub API by filtering users in Basel with over 10 followers and fetching their most recent repositories using the requests library of Python.
- A significant portion of repositories in Basel are written in JavaScript but surprisingly PHP is also seen in many repositories.
- Developers in Basel should focus on collaboration in JavaScript-based and Python-based projects to leverage the local expertise and community.

###### The code used to scrape the users and repositories is written in fetch.py 
###### The analysis of the data using Pandas library is written in the TDSP1.ipynb notebook.
